**td**
a small bash todo utility for my personal needs

#### usage

`td h (or -h, --help, help)` to see the usage

the editor as well as the path to the todo file can be changed by editing the script

#### install

it is recommended to put user scripts in `~/.local/bin` and add that to `$PATH`.

download `td` and then `chmod +x td`
