**td**
a small bash todo utility for my personal needs

**usage**

`td` - to list all todos

`td "Hi, mom!"` - to create a new todo

`td e` - to open the todo file in an editor


the editor as well as the path to the todo file can be changed by editing the script

**install**

it is recommended to put user scripts in `~/.local/bin` and add that to `$PATH`.

download `td` and then `chmod +x td`
